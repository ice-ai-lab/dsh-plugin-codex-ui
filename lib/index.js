/**
 * Node half of `dsh-plugin-codex-ui`.
 *
 * The browser half can neither touch the harness filesystem nor mint
 * directories, but the skin's headline gesture is "start a chat without
 * choosing a project" — which needs a real working directory to exist before a
 * session can be rooted in it. This half therefore exposes three routes over
 * HTTP:
 *
 *   - allocate one disposable working directory under the harness home, which
 *     is what a project-less chat lives in;
 *   - report that directory's root, which is how the browser tells a workspace
 *     this skin minted from one the reader registered on purpose;
 *   - delete directories this plugin allocated, which is what rolls a fresh
 *     directory back when the Host refuses the workspace or the session it was
 *     minted for, and what the browser half's cleanup uses to reclaim a chat
 *     that was started and then abandoned without ever being used.
 *
 * Every route is a plain `exact` route rather than a generated Remote
 * namespace, because an out-of-tree plugin has no codegen step and each payload
 * is a short JSON object.
 *
 * The allocation root is deliberately NOT the `scratch` directory another
 * sidebar skin uses: two plugins sharing one root would let either one's
 * cleanup delete the other's live session directories. Names are entirely
 * server-generated and the root is fixed, so no caller-supplied path ever
 * reaches the filesystem:
 *
 *   - allocation never accepts a path from the caller;
 *   - deletion accepts NAMES only, each validated as a single path segment and
 *     re-checked for containment after resolution, and the root itself is never
 *     a deletion target.
